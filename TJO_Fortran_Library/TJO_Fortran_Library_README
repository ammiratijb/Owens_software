Subroutine Library of TJ Owens

This library has evolved since around 1980.  Some of the routines have morphed from those provided by others in
my early days of programming and the original authors are unclear in some cases.  I acknowledge and thank these
anonymous contributors and will happily explicitly acknowledge anyone who steps forward to assert their 
contribution.

Some of these routines, especially the io routines, require a common block in the main program.  
This can be gleaned from looking at the code, as can the proper usage.

The routines, organized in logical subsets, are:

==============
  IO Routines
=============

     function ask(quest)  - interactive i-o for real numbers, ask a question in quotes, respond with a real number
     subroutine asktxt(quest,answer) - interactive i-o for character strings, respond with a string
     function iask(quest) - interactive i-o for integer responses.
     logical function yesno(quest) - interactive i-o for logical responses.

==================
  Character Information/Manipulation
==================

     integer function blank(file)  --routine to find the position of the first blank (' ')
     integer function period(file) -- routine to find the position of the first period ('.') in a string
     integer function uscore(file) -- routine to find the position of the first underscore ('_') in a string

=================
  Date/Time manipulations
=================

      integer function daymo (dofy,month,day,year) - Julian Day/Year to Month/Day
      integer function doy (month,day,year) - Month/Day to Julian Day
      subroutine juli(yr,jday,month,iday,monum) - Another Julian day to month/day subroutine
      integer function lpyr(year) - determines if a year is a leap year

==============
  Seismic Utilities
==============

     subroutine sacio(file,x,np,dt,inout) - writes a SAC file without access to SAC libraries
     subroutine rotseis(x,m,n,baz,az,npts) - rotates a 3-component seismogram
     subroutine azdist(stalat, stalon, evtlat, evtlon,delta, az, baz) - compute Great Circle Arc distance.

     subroutine rdlyrs (sitefl,nlyrs,title,vp,vs,rho,h,qp,qs,strike,dip,iflag,ier) - reads a layered model
     subroutine iniocm - related to sacio and /tjocm/ block initialization

     subroutine coef8(p,vp1,vs1,ro1,vp2,vs2,ro2,ncode,nd,rmod,rph) - compute reflection/transmission coefficients.
     subroutine coefsh(p,vs1,rho1,vs2,rho2,ncode,rmod,rph) - reflection/transmission for SH waves

     function fsorce (isorfn,f,delay,kstrtd,a,b,t,wo,trap) - returns one of several standard source functions
     real function ptrvlt(gcarc,depth,itbl) - returns P-travel time in Herrin model by reading a table
     subroutine seisio(freq,peak,xr,xi,inout) - adds/removes a WWSSN instrument response
     subroutine sit2(psvsh,c,freq,resp,alfa,beta,qp,qs,rho,thik,nlyrs) - Thomson-Haskel layered response

=================
  Math and Signal Processing
================

      subroutine coord(x,theta,delta,y,trans,same) - coordinate transformation for 3-component vector
      function dot(x,y) - returns dot product of 3-component vectors x and y
      subroutine max(x,n,xmax) - returns maximum value of x, length n
      subroutine minmax(x,npts,min,max,mean) - returns min, max and mean of x, length npts
      function npowr2(n) - returns next power of 2 greater than integer n
      function sinc(x) - calculates and returns sin(x)/x for a real number x
      subroutine zeerow(x,start,end) - zeroes array x in the range of indexes from "start" to "end"

      subroutine dfftr (x,nft,dirctn,delta) - Tony Shakal's FFT routine
      call myfft (x,nftby2,+1) - Part of FFT
      subroutine locast(dirctn,invrse,forwrd) - Part of FFT
      subroutine myfft(data,nn,isign) - Part of FFT


=================
Lawson/Hanson routines from Chuck Ammon for use with some of his routines
These are in a separate library (lh.a)
=================

      function diffr(x,y) - returns difference between x and y, lawson/hanson routine
      subroutine g1(a,b,cos,sin,sig) - lawson/hanson routine
      subroutine g2(cos,sin,x,y) - lawson/hanson routine
      subroutine h12(mode,lpivot,l1,m,u,iue,up,c,ice,icv,ncv) - lawson/hanson routine
      subroutine qrbd(ipass,q,e,nn,v,mdv,nrv,c,mdc,ncc) - lawson/hanson routine
      subroutine svdrs(a,mda,mm,nn,b,mdb,nb,s) - lawson/hanson SVD routine
