This distribution is intended for people who know a little about software development, compiling programs, Makefiles, etc.

The codes work for me with the g95 compile (www.g95.org) on G4/G5 Macs, Linux (64-bit Opteron processor), and Intel Macs.
There are still a fair number of warning messages, but ... look closely ... its easy to lose errors in a bunch of warnings.

This is unlikely to be a turnkey, blackbox, distribution.  
You need to look over any error messages and try to fix things before coming to me for help.

Steps:

1.  Try running Compile_All.sh

If it actually works, you will have all the executables in the bin directory!

If it doesn't, then work down that script directory by directory and see what went wrong.

2.  When codes in Rcvr_Func_Codes and Seismic_Utilites compile, there are test examples to run in various subdirectories.  Run those and convince yourself that things are running.

There are README type files around and about to help you understand things.  Look at them all.

Sorry this is not more user-friendly.  But, as they say, these work for me.  
Maybe I will get better at distributions over time.

thanks, tjo

I decided to put those codes on GitHub
They're very useful to compute RF using a pulse stripping deconvolution method 
(Ligorrıa, J. and Ammon, C.J., 1999. Iterative deconvolution and receiverfunction 
estimation,Bull. seism. Soc. Am.,89,1395–1400)

To compile everything, just run ./Compile_All
binaries are placed in the bin directory. Then, set your PATH accordingly.

Everything works with the gfortran compiler on Linux64 and MACOS
Be careful, newer versions of gfortran (e.g. V10) return errors, make sure to 
use a previous version (V6 and V7 are fine)
